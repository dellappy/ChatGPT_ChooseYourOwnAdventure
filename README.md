## ChatGPT as GameMaster of a Choose Your Own Adventure game

This is a for-fun proof-of-concept project showing how ChatGPT can be harnessed to become the Game Master of a Choose Your Own Adventure -style game. This leverages on the techniques taught in the excellent [ChatGPT: Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) course taught by Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford, coupled with a simple chat-window GUI modified from [Patrick Loeber's repo](https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-fun/blob/master/chatbot-gui/app.py). We shall call our app ***Chat-Adventure GPT*** !

In the Jupyter notebook contained in this repo, we shall first detail how we build Chat-Adventure GPT, and afterward we will discuss known limitations and possible extensions. We will also provide screenshots of sample adventures that Chat-Adventure GPT has taken us on.
